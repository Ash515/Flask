# Flask
Flask is a popular Python web framework, meaning it is a third-party Python library used for developing web applications. Flask is an API of Python that allows us to build up web-applications. It was developed by Armin Ronacher. Flask's framework is more explicit than Django's framework and is also easier to learn because it has less base code to implement a simple web-Application.
